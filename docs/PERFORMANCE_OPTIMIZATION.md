# 🚀 Performance Optimization - Weekly Sync

## 📊 **Problem**
Weekly Sync page was taking **38 seconds** to load in production, which is unacceptable for user experience.

## 🎯 **Target**
Reduce loading time to **under 5 seconds** for optimal user experience.

## 🔧 **Optimizations Implemented**

### **1. Global Timer Implementation**
- ✅ **Global timer** starts immediately on navigation (not component mount)
- ✅ **Accurate measurement** from user click to data ready
- ✅ **Display loading time** in header: `Weekly Sync (waktu loading: 2.3s)`

### **2. SWR Caching Optimization**
- ✅ **Increased deduping interval** from 4-5 minutes to 10 minutes
- ✅ **Disabled revalidation** on focus and reconnect
- ✅ **Reduced error retry count** from 3 to 2
- ✅ **Added error retry interval** of 1 second
- ✅ **Added focus throttle** of 5 seconds

### **3. Aggressive Prefetching**
- ✅ **Parallel data fetching** for all weekly data
- ✅ **Prefetch unscheduled tasks** and scheduled tasks
- ✅ **Prefetch progress calculations** to avoid N+1 queries
- ✅ **Cache all data** in SWR for instant access

### **4. Loading Experience Enhancement**
- ✅ **Skeleton loading** with animated placeholders
- ✅ **Better loading message**: "Loading Weekly Sync..."
- ✅ **Visual feedback** during data fetching

### **5. Database Query Optimization**
- ✅ **Parallel progress calculations** instead of sequential
- ✅ **Batch queries** where possible
- ✅ **Reduced N+1 query problems**

## 📈 **Expected Results**

### **Before Optimization:**
- ❌ Loading time: **38 seconds**
- ❌ Poor user experience
- ❌ No loading feedback
- ❌ Sequential data fetching

### **After Optimization:**
- ✅ Loading time: **< 5 seconds** (target)
- ✅ Excellent user experience
- ✅ Skeleton loading + progress indicator
- ✅ Parallel data fetching + aggressive caching

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Performance Monitoring:**
1. **Timer display** shows actual loading time
2. **Skeleton loading** provides visual feedback
3. **Caching** reduces subsequent load times

### **Expected Improvements:**
- **First load**: 2-5 seconds (down from 38s)
- **Subsequent loads**: < 1 second (cached)
- **User perception**: Much faster due to skeleton loading

## 🔍 **Monitoring & Maintenance**

### **Key Metrics to Watch:**
- Loading time displayed in header
- User feedback on performance
- Cache hit rates
- Database query performance

### **Future Optimizations:**
- Database indexing optimization
- CDN implementation
- Service worker for offline caching
- Progressive loading for large datasets

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Loading time < 5 seconds
- [ ] User satisfaction improved
- [ ] No regression in functionality
- [ ] Cache effectiveness > 80%
